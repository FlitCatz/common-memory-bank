Identify the memory bank of the current project and the task list generated from taskmaster, and check the current work in progress.

Follow these steps:

1. Check all the main md files in the memory-bank folder.
2. Check the status of the entire work through the `task-master list` CLI syntax.
3. If there are differences between memory-bank and taskmaster, modify them so that they match while preserving more recent or more specific information.
4. Mention the next work to be done.
